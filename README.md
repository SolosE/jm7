GD Contact Widget using BeaverBuilder shows on select pages, the most common title pages
The social Icons appear on Home, Contact US, and About Us.  Odd that they appear on the common named pages but they do not appear on the Unique pages, ie Investor Relations, Products.  I see the code when I INSPECT it, but I can't get it to appear?  Very odd.  I am using the GD widget with Beaver Builder.
